# MQTT-DotNet - Pub/Sub

This project contains a basic MQTT publisher and subscriber implementation in .NET Core.
The publisher allows sending text messages to an MQTT broker on specified topics.
The subscriber can subscribe to topics and receive messages published to them.
Both applications use the MQTTnet client library and are configured via appsettings.json.
This demonstrates a simple pub/sub messaging architecture using the lightweight MQTT protocol.
